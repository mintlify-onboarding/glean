Once you get access to Glean, you will be invited to login to a project. Users can belong to multiple projects, but data cannot be shared between projects. So users, permissions, database connections, data models and every other resource is isolated in the context of a project. Typically your entire organization can be managed in a single project.

<Info> **Not ready to connect to a database?**- You can use a [Sandbox demo project](/project-management/demo-projects) to test the functionality of Glean with sample datasets. </Info>

## 1. Add a database connection
Also see [database connections](/project-management/database-connections) for configurations specific to different database types.

<Warning> **Firewall Configuration**- If you use a firewall to restrict access to your database, you'll need to allowlist Glean's IPs.
Glean will always connect to your database from one of these IP addresses.  ```18.210.29.198
34.230.230.9``` </Warning>
